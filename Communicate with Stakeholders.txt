Hi Team,

I hope you are doing well.

I am Priyank, working as Data Analyst in the Engineering team under Manager Cole. He informed me about developing a data warehouse based on three data sources to get business insights. Currently, I am working on initial analysis for data model that will help us build reports and/or perform data visualization to better support decision making. Since this task is mainly focused on data quality, I have some questions about it.

1. Nature of Data Warehouse
   I have received three data sources - Users, Brands and Receipts.
   I'd like to know what is the purpose or in which direction do we want to develop our data warehouse.
   Example: Data Warehouse for Financial Data or Operational or Customer Data?
 
2. Data Quality
   While going through the data sources, I found some quality issues with it. 
   a. There are certain fields that have 'Null' values, which I believe won't be useful in getting any business insights.
      Example: topBrand has 'Null' values
   b. Fields like finalPrice have data type NVARCHAR(String value) and I believe this field should be of type Money/Currency.
   c. We have two fields in Receipts data source purchasedItemCount (total number of items purchased in one receipt) and quantityPurchased (individual quantity of  item purchased in same receipt). Based on my analysis, the count should match for both these fields in a way that purchasedItemCount equals to sum of all quantityPurchased field for the same receipt.
      i.e. purchasedItemCount=SUM(quantityPurchased)
      But there are cases where counts of these fields are not matching. 
      Example: The count for one of the receipt purchasedItemCount is 2 and sum of quantityPurchased is 4.
    
3. Business Requirements
   a. Are fields with 'Null' values expected? If yes, could you please explain the business logic behind it?
      Example: Referring to point 2a, we will miss out on those brands where the topBrand field has null values
   b. Should we have default values at least for certain fields that play a crucial role building a data warehouse?
   c. Could you please mention the purpose of storing the currency fields as string instead of Money/Currency data type?

4. Performance and Scaling
   Currently, the fields for currencies are stored in string data type. In order to perform operations on it, we need to convert it into Money/Currency data type. If we do this conversion at runtime, it will take time and hence will impact the performance of reports running on production. Instead, what we can do here is, store these values as Money/Currency data type which will eliminate the runtime conversion logic and thus improve our performance and make it more scalable.

If I have answers for these questions it will be really helpful to build the data model taking all the necessary things into consideration.
Let me know if you need more details and we can schedule a call to discuss it.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Regards,
Priyank
